# Team Profile Generator

## Description
This application was built to create a team profile that requires user input using the inquire module from Node.JS. The user input will be used to create a dynamically styled HTML webpage that contains the information provided by the user. This application showcases the use of Object Oriented Programming for handling information and Test Driven Development using Jest to run tests.

## Installation
Please download all files in repository, Node.js, and Jest to run tests. 

## Usage
initialize the app by entering 'node index.js' in the command line, and answer all questions asked in the terminal. Once all questions are answered the user will go to the output folder and see a file titled "team_html". The user will then open in their default browser and be presented with the information that they provided for their team.
